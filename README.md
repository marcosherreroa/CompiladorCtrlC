# CompiladorCtrlC
This repo contains the final project of the course Procesadores de Lenguajes, which I took in my fourth year on my Computer Science Engineering degree. It consists in a C-like language compiler. The following technologies were used: 
* JLex for the Lexical Analyzer. 
* JCUP for the Syntactic Analyzer. 
* Java for the construction of the Abstract Syntax Tree, the binding of variables and the typechecking. 
* WebAssembly for the Code Generation.  

My grade was 9.
